# Customer_Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors. It helps businesses better understand their customers' needs and preferences, leading to more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction. K-means clustering is a popular technique used for customer segmentation, as it can automatically partition customers into distinct groups based on their features.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how K-means clustering can be applied to perform customer segmentation using Python and the scikit-learn library. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify different segments of customers with similar attributes such as age, income, and spending behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, including their age, annual income, and spending score. Each row represents a customer, and the columns represent different features that describe the customers' characteristics.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and any missing values are handled appropriately. We also standardize the features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
Determining the Number of Clusters: We use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation. This involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters and selecting the "elbow point," where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down.
K-means Clustering: Based on the optimal number of clusters identified, we apply the K-means algorithm to partition the customers into distinct clusters. Each customer is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid based on their feature values.
Visualization: We visualize the clusters using a scatter plot, where each point represents a customer. The x-axis and y-axis represent two of the features used for clustering (e.g., annual income and spending score), and each cluster is depicted with a different color.
Results
The results of the customer segmentation analysis provide insights into different customer segments based on their age, income, and spending behavior. By understanding the characteristics of each segment, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service initiatives to better meet the needs of their target audience.

## Usage
To use this code for customer segmentation with your own dataset:
1.Replace the Customers.csv file with your dataset containing customer information.
2.Run the Python script customer_segmentation.py.
3.Analyze the generated clusters and adjust the parameters as needed to optimize the segmentation results.
